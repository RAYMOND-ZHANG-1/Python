# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis
Instacart, an online grocery store that operates
through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more
information about their sales patterns.
# Objective
Your task is to perform an initial data and exploratory
analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better
segmentation based on the provided criteria.
# Data
Opened source from Instacart website
https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017
# Result
##1).Our customers who ordered back under 10 days have 72% and who order back between 10 and 20 days have 21%,
we only have 7% of customers who order back above 20 days. This is a good flage, I recommend to focus on those
orders between 10 and 20 days customers and do ads on them to increase the percentage under 10 days.
##2).Generally speacking, there is no big difference base on our customer's loyalty flag and most of customers like buying from produce, dairy eggs and snacks department. These 3 departments always need to be stocked enough.
3).South ordered most in the frour regions and Northwest ordered the least. However, whatever customers from which region and they all have the similiar ordering habits.
4).Our most orders came from the customers who got married and have at least one dependants and age above 35 with middle income level (means income between 52000 and 125000). The old people whose age above 55 are the most potential group to order more from us and the young peope are the group that ordered the least. We should do some promotions to these young parents, like sales on baby's staffs.
